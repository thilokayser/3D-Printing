# PLA Ironing 

Not a problem. Here it is:

Ironing pattern: Zig zag

Ironing Line Spacing 0.2 mm (if using 0.4 mm nozzle then I would still leave it as that, as reducing it seems to reduce the quality. I guess it "cuts" across the bow wave.

Ironing flow: 26%

Ironing inset: Half your nozzle

Ironing speed: 150 mm/s

Things that need to be improved: I need to set a far higher temperature when ironing. I would like to iron with the highest temperature for that filament possible.

  

Problems: In smaller areas with a lot of turns, you get (on a big nozzle like I am using here), resonance vibrations on CR-10. They have to do with the tiny bit of extra plastic you get when the printer changes direction in your underlying prints. These make the print head resonate upwards. On the downwards resonation, it collects too much PLA in the bow wave, which it then deposits on the next upward swing.

Printer also sounds like it will shake itself to pieces :)

How to solve this: Increase ironing temperature to allow the PLA to melt better and allow a smoother passage of the print head and a smoother bow wave.
